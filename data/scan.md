# Scanning Data

Data from the [Alexa top million sites](http://www.alexa.com/topsites).

Run using `./scan.sh` .

- The scanning can be aborted, but this will result in some 143 errors for curl. Remove the resulting files before continuing.
- `empowernetwork.com` is doing sort of SEO hacking to get non-standard URLs into the Alexa rankings. These will fail.
